how's everyone

doing in the in the spirit of keeping

Noster weird weird I'm going to do this

interview

Barefoot um Edward I'm not I'm not sure

if you have shoes on or not but I hope

not I hope you're

comfortable I uh I can't see you guys at

all but uh I'm wearing slippers and uh

no pants so this will this will be just

fine perfect okay we're starting it

we're too thank you um Edward so we're

we're going to we're going to have a

conversation and we're going to

intersperse with some questions from you

all so um I'm G call out and if you have

a question just raise your hand we have

many more people running around with

with microphones Edward I just wanted to

start by saying um this is the second

time I've actually had a conversation

with you in front of an audience the

first time was when I was running

Twitter and it's just amazing right now

to have what I think will be a similar

conversation but one in a very corporate

context and now in a protocol context

and what that enables and what that uh

what that will allow so I feel um I feel

pretty amazing and honored to always

when I'm in your presence but whenever

you your image comes up on the screen I

get I get chills just because of the the

sacrifice you made uh for all of us and

I just want to start this conversation

by acknowledging and appre and showing

our appreciation for you and and we're

so grateful for everything that you've

sacrificed to show the world um how it

was working and and how we can be better

to each other and what we need to build

to get there so thank you first of

all

well thank you I mean that that's a very

warm welcome to to everybody in the room

thank you uh it's funny actually now now

being 10 years on uh you know the world

has moved on in a lot of way it's nice

to be

remembered it's hard sometimes for me

personally to

remember uh oh what it was like 10 years

ago and and taking that leap uh to the

surprise of everyone I think myself

first of all uh I'm still here and I

made it in in a lot of way

uh personally I I won I got away with it

there's a big cost uh that was imposed I

I'm living in Exile today uh but I think

that also puts me in pretty good company

so I I try not to let that hurt my

feelings uh too much you

know uhon Aristotle died in Exile uh

Cicero uh was in Exile he eventually

returned um AIT died in

Exile

uh

Emma Goldman in in much more recent

times they were they were forced in

Exile so there's a long history of the

thing there and if you think about uh

what they were doing in every case that

sent them

there it was not that they were an enemy

of the people uh but that their views

had had made them An Enemy of the State

and that that actually brings me to my

my first question for you jack because

uh people who are

successful uh in the modern world uh

particularly on the corporate level uh

they get approach they're interconnected

with uh governments um particularly when

it's like a communications platform or a

financial platform you're one of the few

people um in the modern world who's

really sat at like the The Sweet Spot in

that vend diagram of both from Twitter

and and from block uh so you've seen

both the regular at pressures from the

finance side and the communication side

and I think it's something that we see

happening largely uh on the

internet everywhere uh where when I was

growing up when you were growing up when

a lot of people in the audience were

growing up uh not the case for some of

the the younger members of our audience

they've seen that this is sort of the

way it always

was but the internet was amazing it was

something special it was something the

governments didn't really understand

they couldn't really intrude upon they

were just kind of sitting back and

watching to see what happened uh and

then suddenly the interet went from

being amazing to not and Twitter felt

the same way it was amazing and suddenly

it was not and the world frankly uh in

recent years uh when we go back to

younger days maybe it's you know

rose-colored glasses and Nostalgia but I

think there's a little bit more to it uh

everything was amazing and then suddenly

not you know Corey Doo has talked about

his theory of inhi ification if you can

excuse the language but you know this is

a little less formal uh where we got the

free ride on the internet of of the

creative generation and the sharing

culture uh and

now the profiteers have sort of moved in

uh the pressures and the fiduciary

duties have uh sort of overcome and now

the state is changing uh but I I think

it's not just the network State uh

that's being changed the state of the

services but but the state of the world

and I just you know broadly thinking how

do you see what's going on the journey

you've had your involvement these things

and just what can you tell us about how

the world looks from your

perspective

um I I think you uh well I I had very

similar I had a very similar feeling

about the early internet when when I

first discovered it that I think you've

described and I I just recently reread

your your book permanent re record I I

didn't reread it I relistened to it your

your narrator is excellent by the way um

and it's just amazing to to see how

curious and driven you were by the

feeling of the internet more than

anything else and and how it could make

people feel how it made you feel and I

think everyone in this room has had that

feeling it it feels open it feels

permissionless it feels wild and weird

and um and unexpected in almost every

way and I in my life I had never planned

to to really be a CEO or even start a

business but it happened to be the most

effective way to spread the idea and in

in in this case it was it was Twitter

but what I what I learned uh when I was

in it is

the there grows um these single points

of

failure um and the single point of the

number one single point of failure was

was

myself um in that I was leading and

making decisions around this for

hundreds of millions of people and

policy

um the the next was what you mentioned

incentives around

Revenue Twitter um was beautiful in the

early days and Rabel has talked about

this and that it was a pretty wide

openen API to the degree where uh we had

so many developers on it experimenting

actually a lot of them in Japan Japan

was our biggest Market um because we had

so many developers use the API to make

things like tamagachi that you could

feed and you could see pass away and

live and smile it was amazing but it

actually brought the sight down all the

time

time and uh and we got this this fail

whale and um but that's when it most

felt like a protocol and that's when it

most it felt most like it felt the most

special as soon as we grew we we started

with that feeling but then we took money

from

fe's and we made people that we employed

a promise that these shairs that we

would give them would be

worth some meaningful amount more than

they were today and that just set up a

whole series of events that took us

public and before that created a a

business model such as advertising which

became another single point of failure

is the advertising pressure and the and

the revenue model um I've said in the

past that like if if Bitcoin existed

before Twitter started we would have had

a much better option and a much better

path and removed at least one of the

single points of failure and that's what

makes me so excited about NST is it does

have Micro payments like it's real it's

it's a scaled experiment that we can

actually learn from and that to me is so

rare and and so amazing that it actually

exists uh right now and people can play

with it and most importantly feel it and

then the last single point of failure

that was meaningful was what you

mentioned in terms of the government in

terms of regulators obviously a lot of

this was exposed in the Twitter files

and it's um it's very challenging as an

individual or anyone in the company when

the government or any government comes

knocking at your door it's very hard

to um take the stand that that you took

um especially as you have have concerns

about revenue and the company just going

away because we're the smallest of the

Giants against Facebook and Google and

everything else and

um all that to

say what I think is changing and these

are all pendulum pendulum

swings and I think the pendulum is

swinging back to a world where we can

actually persist more open protocols

because we have things like Bitcoin

where everyone who contributes to

bitcoin from a development perspective

or from a marketing perspective or a

policy perspective makes it better for

everyone else who does the same thing

and you have this very interesting

virtuous Loop and I think the same is

true for for Noster um and that to me

the most powerful idea is not that it's

recreating twitter- like things or or

handling the social media use case but

it's this open permissionless ecosystem

system of apps that anyone who creates

one of those and it's great actually

benefits the entire

ecosystem so it's this like cooperation

that continues to build upon itself in

in a very unique way and I just don't I

don't know if we've had the tools to do

that before but maybe we did on the

internet and and you know the the um the

the downfall was the centralization of

the discovery mechanism that's where

Google came in that's where Facebook

came in that's where Twitter came in

yeah away from the use Nets away from

the irc's away from um gopher and all

these technologies that were truly

decentralized but really hard to find

something on so how how do you think

about you know

Discovery oh you know it's really

interesting that you just said that

because I've been thinking in like just

the last two months uh whenever I use a

search engine now the results are

terrible they're useless uh and I don't

know if you know and I've used multiple

search engines uh I I use it last but

I've even used Google which is supposed

to be the best I've used Bing I've used

duck. go you know whatever I star page

all these other ones uh but you're all

getting kind of the same thing and I can

no longer find uh what I need usefully

at all it's it's there's you can't

discover um specific things from the

internet if I want something general if

I want something generic

sure um but particularly if you're

looking for technical content specialist

content uh it's really very difficult to

get

the uh search engine and narrow down

what you want and like if I could just

run a Rex against the internet um it

would I could get exactly what I needed

but they the search engines don't let

you operate like this anymore even you

know Google they used to have a ton of

search engine operators uh 10 years ago

like Google hacking was a thing um and

now it's all been

so closed down locked down that you

can't do any of this stuff anymore it's

actually interesting it's kind of

similar I think to what you were

recalling about Twitter's API now that

elon's taken over uh we lost a lot of

basic functions like there was a great

uh command Tool uh called SNS scrape uh

or I guess SN scrape for social network

craber um and you didn't need

credentials you didn't need anything

like that for Twitter and if you wanted

to look at a tag and like how many

people were doing this you know you

could pull tens of thousands of

tweets uh and you know time or to do

anything like filtered down and it was

amazing uh the kind of insight that you

could get from the network uh it was

just it was just freely available uh the

only burden was knowledge if you

understood how to interact with it you

could do it um Twitter search was way

better than a lot of other ones you know

you could put in the little twitch uh

twitch uh Twitter

box things like you know

um uh Minore retweets colon and then

something say you know I only want to

see tweets that were effectively popular

U and yeah all that starts disappearing

that that level of control disappears

and we see the amount the kinds of

content the kinds of speech that are

permissible on these networks uh

beginning to be narrow we're seeing

YouTube go through their big sprint now

they've been doing it for a long time

really ever since they put in that

really harsh content ID system I like if

it even thinks music that's in your

video sounds like a copyrighted song it

just completely you know delists or

reassigns uh sort of earning power to

whoever makes a claim and so then you

know all these scammers and boders

realize they could create like sound

alike songs and then uh put those out

there or use music that wasn't in

copyright but they could claim copyright

for that and then they could start

getting the ad revenue for you know an

entire giant network of people who would

just use this free uh no copyright music

and it just goes on and on and on like

there's this level of uh sort of

anti-social activity that exists in any

open network that exists uh in you know

open life

outside uh there's always going to be a

uh criminal or non-cooperative element

in

society theoretically uh one of the

roles of government is to kind of make

sure those don't step on the toes of

everybody else too heart right to to try

to manage it the problem starts when

they go oh well we can eliminate this

and you get the Messianic vision of what

uh government could be or the

institution can be and you actually see

this uh beginning more strongly to

infect uh major media institutions

recently which is quite difficult uh

where they go you know certain kinds of

speech are impermissible where we don't

put here we don't show here we don't

publish here the debate is narrowed as

opposed to the old uh sort

of uh like the the meme buff doggy

versus uh CHS right where you've got the

one that's jacked how it used to be and

then you know the little sad pudgy one

that that as it exists today it used to

be that we said you

know the way to deal with bad speech is

more speech you drag the bad argument

out into the light you discredit it you

show why it's unconvincing uh and then

people no longer adhere to that idea

well nowadays we go well let's just hide

it let's put it in the dark well bad

ideas grow best in the dark where they

aren't challenged where they aren't

confronted uh and communities develop

out of that and just a whole universe of

problems derived from that but what I

wanted to get back to which which you

had sort of gotten into with this API

and everything else is you were talking

about how when Twitter was small and was

organic when it was frankly unreliable

and failing a lot uh you

got a lot of small communities

interested communities creative

communities uh who were doing things

with it that you guys never expected

like for me when I I tweeted in Japanese

a few times cuz you know I lived in

Japan many many years ago um working for

the NSA at the time

uh you can transmit much more

information in a tweet in Japanese than

pretty much every any other language

I've ever seen and that was a surprise

to me uh but it it turns out that um

Japanese compresses very well to the

Tweet format uh so it's sort of

unsurprising that but the idea that I

wanted to say was small

communities tend to be better governed

um and the larger that we get a sprawl

um sort of the worse it becomes more

competing the more

factionalism uh and the more sort of win

or take all Behavior where it becomes

you know a contest for Conquest I think

and this is what alarms me is when we

see this happening with

speech and you know Twitter's Under New

Management now we've got the sort of

Elon era upon us and you know frankly I

I think he has been trying to theb do

the best he can I'm I'm not really

impressed with some of the decisions uh

that we've seen particular closing off

apis and everything like that is going

to solve the bot problem and now any uh

tweet that has any word that's even

crypto adjacent in it has like 700 of

the same replies underneath it it's like

come on you know that that can't be that

hard to fix particularly when you're

charging them a dollar to to make that

tweet or whatever that account um there

is a risk of a False Consensus

forming

uh and actually I don't want to ramble

too much because I know I've been

speaking for like five minutes straight

here

but when we talk about policy when we

talk about government when we talk about

Regulators uh there's an idea that what

the people who are currently in power

are thinking in their heads right now uh

what's popular at the New York Times

what's popular at the Washington Post uh

that's not popular that's correct uh and

that every right-minded person shares

that belief and it's a presumed belief

they haven't done the work of convincing

they haven't done the work of persuading

uh they simply assume that everybody

else naturally should understand why

this is right that it is right that it

should not be

challenged and anyone who deviates from

this belief by a certain degree is

spreading disinformation they are

misinforming people they have become you

know a network threat they have become a

Civic or public threat and they need to

be shut out and that's one of the things

that's you know really impressed me when

you know Frankly Speaking you're a guy

who's you know been to the top made a

zillion dollars from from Twitter or

whatever it's very easy for you just to

be like well it didn't work out but I

got mine and sort of ride off into the

sunset uh a lot of people do that in the

world but instead here you are right

back at it again and the thing that you

said public L that that struck me is you

said you know you

thought the basic mistake with Twitter

was not making in a protocol you

publicly pressured uh or at least

invited Elon many times uh to take

Twitter to be protocol based and here

you are with nosters saying you know it

needs to be an unowned protocol uh and

the fact that we have

uh basically independent speech and we

have at least the this hook here uh for

independent payments uh to me is the

real game Cher I mean that's

what basically limits the damage that

these government Regulatory and

institutional speeches can do to Public

Health right because they're supposed to

be protecting health and frankly even

the worst of us understand that

government can have a positive role

uh even for the most radical of us if

they're kept within the box right of of

where they need to be when starts

climbing out of that box that's when

things get dangerous and so we need to

have pretty strong box we need to have

pretty strong borders and the only

Technical Solutions that we have found

to legal or policy problems uh in the

Computing era uh have been ones that are

that are uh hardlines like encryption uh

or like the fact that this is a protocol

right and you can't just go to someone

and say take this down you can go to a

node owner you can go to relay owner and

ask nicely uh but you can't just you

know say do this or you go to jail and

then poof it's gone because Elon Musk

who's you know purportedly the richest

or one of the richest men in the world

right now uh really shouldn't be the

type to be getting pushed around like

the Indian government uh was like oh

take this down these were clearly things

that shouldn't have been taken down he

was like oh it's the law you know poof

it's

gone

uh so I I went on too long there but uh

I just want to say like I I really

appreciate uh the role that you are

playing in not simply packing up and

going away but but trying to iterate

because that's how things get better

right nobody makes this stuff perfect at

once doesn't work at frankly Noster

might not work at all it might not scale

uh I've mentioned before like when I use

Noster right now I have a lot of trouble

connecting through tour I don't see

things I got to reconnect 10 times it's

whatever uh but these are early days and

things do get better

um but whether it's Communications

whether it's payments I've talked before

about this idea we need a first post

National Bank right uh you know we don't

need the Bank of America we don't need

the bank of Russia we don't need the

Bank of China uh we need something that

is postnational not just extr National

postnational it's imagining a world

where you know states are not the top

tier of deciding who gets paid and who

who doesn't get paid we need that same

thing for speech and I I think protocol

based communication is like the internet

everything that we're doing right now

you know TCP I basically uh and so even

if we get it wrong even if there are

dark points uh we can come out of that

and things can get better as long as we

keep trying uh and I've had a tough

couple of years frankly looking at the

direction of the internet looking at the

direction of Privacy Law looking at uh

this is sort of civil uh dis Decay and

uh the discourse and Decay and to hear

you still optimistic to hear you still

positive to see everyone in the crowd

who's come here right you guys wouldn't

be here uh if you weren't already

outliers uh we don't need everybody in

the world to join us to build something

great uh we just need to care and to try

so I guess this is my turn to to thank

you oh absolutely thank you

um I think um it'd be very very hard to

walk

away knowing everything I learned and

knowing again what you gave us and

knowing that we can fix it seeing

something like Bitcoin and the person or

the people behind it and their intention

to again take everything they learned

and and try to build something better

for the ne for generations to come and

to see something like Noster and fiaa

and everyone working together in a way

that is truly

permissionless and everyone has these

incredible ideas taking feedback from

folks like you and um I hope more and

more regular folks out in the world who

are just trying to express themselves

and um and find expression that

resonates with them you know the the

discoveries problem is still extremely

hard on on nuster and clumsy and it's

it's definitely keeping people away um

but we do have the benefit of a very

early adopter crowd right now where we

can test a bunch on ourselves and we

have the great Fortune of having someone

like like you on user one of my

questions to you and and we should ceue

up some some from the audience as well

would be why why did you start with

Noster and why are you sticking around

because

a lot of a lot of what you're bringing

to the world right now requires or or

benefits from a large

audience and you probably have the

smallest possible audience with Nostra

at the

moment so so why are why are you here

thank you

but yeah I mean it's funny if you look

at uh my Twitter account um I I hardly

ever tweet anymore I've got I don't know

five to six million followers on that

account um so it is it is a big

megaphone one I mean I I see there's a

lot less engagement on Twitter than you

would expect I don't know if that's

because I'm you know no longer within

the grace of the uh the algorithm uh or

or but but uh the idea that you know you

get a hundred billion or or whatever

times more amplification is not always

strictly true even if it appears that it

should be true uh because it's not like

you know five million people are

following this account five million

people get served this tweet should be

that way but it's not right um so it's

it's not just black or white but more uh

directly in real

terms people on Twitter have stopped

listening um and it's it's not to me

they've stopped listening to to anybody

and this is more of a global problem um

than a specific Twitter social network

problem but I think social network uh

social media and Twitter are emblematic

of this in the specific

um everybody is shouting and nobody's

listening um I see the sort of

disruption uh that was coming with the

the the sale and the transfer and

everything's changing and it it it makes

you realize that Twitter may not be

forever um and Twitter is not as

reliable as uh you know

you want it to be if you're someone like

me and and you really sort of depend on

this as your megaphone because you know

I'm not on Instagram I'm not on Facebook

I'm not on Tik Tok and I never was uh

Noster to me seems like more than uh you

know just

another big media property specifically

because the idea that it's uh the

unowned protocol and and that to me is

attractive that's something I want to

see succeed I want to move

the uh sort of Authority for what people

see in their feed away from the

aggregator and toward the user now that

that doesn't need to be an extreme it's

not like a dial that you have to pin one

way or the other uh the user justes have

like manually click block block don't

show me this shouldn't have to uh for 10

billion tweets they should be able to

select like content type lists or

whatever or Community Source lists uh

for these are good accounts these are

bad accounts like let's get started

quickly you follow all these people or

uh you don't see tweets from all these

accounts that are spammy or gambling or

whatever you don't like

um but these are human decisions right

these are personal decisions these are

individual decisions uh and sometimes

they're Collective decisions but they're

not corporate decisions they're not

government decisions they're not

regulatory decisions when they come to

comes to speech I think that's really

important the second thing is nasr is

just more pleasant right now uh I mean

when you are not a

bitcoiner uh there is a lot of content

that I think for the average person is

dry and we do have to get beyond that

stage to make it more inviting uh if we

want the network to grow but for

somebody who is interested um in Bitcoin

uh to see you know just it's an organic

it's a small community it's just a start

but to see the potential to see the

enthusiasm and again just to see the

genuine kindness on a basic level uh

that's nice I think you look at the

history of the world small governments

tend to be better governments small

communities tend to be more kind

communities and it's as they you depart

from this small sort of uh

like-minded community on toward the

journey to realize the superstate right

the global power um that a lot of those

ideals and a lot of that vision gets

shaken loose like dust on the road um

and it's because they have to sacrifices

have to be made uh in the name of

Conquest if you're going in that

direction but there is a magic in uh the

early days the early Network and the

idea the dream um and frankly I would

not have done uh what I did in

2013 uh if I wasn't an idealist if I

wasn't an optimist uh most people who

could have seen the same thing as me and

to see it in aggregate or in whole would

have been uh a pretty small group of

people but to see it in part there were

a lot a lot a lot of people uh who knew

the wrong things were going on there

nobody said it anything and people go

why and some people think you know it's

self-preservation or cowardice or

whatever and to some degree that that's

correct uh but I think there's also a

more forgiving way of looking at it

which is people didn't think it would

make any

difference uh and and realistically like

what what difference did I make it

didn't save the world it didn't slay the

dragon um and the consequences were

enormous uh the most likely outcome is

that I'd be you know uh sitting a

supermax right now

um and I would for the rest of my life

uh but we do know now we we have brought

a sort of a common level a common

picture a common awareness to the table

not just in the United States but around

the world um and that is something it's

somewhere to start building it's

somewhere to move forward from uh and I

think that's the

basic human

Drive uh where you recognize

risk you know you see the uh tiger's

tail above the grass uh but you go I'm

not just going to sit here and hope it

doesn't see me uh maybe it'll get

somebody else uh maybe I could take a

crack at fixing the tiger problem and

recognize that maybe you might not be

the guy to do and the tiger might get

you

um but that tiger problem is going to

get fixed if enough people try and we

try for long enough uh so anyway I threw

my rock

um but there there's one more thing that

I I I want to get to on that

uh and it's this sense

that government is something that's

being done to us now uh that we don't

really have meaningful control over like

government is a natural

disaster

um and government actually likes that

whatever country you're in right that

they want to be left alone to govern to

make decisions to order to regulate uh

and they don't really want a lot of back

talk um they don't want agitation they

don't want uh dissent they don't want

dissidence there is this

idea among the governing

classes if they're just left alone uh to

do their work things will get better um

that there is a comfortable silence that

if you guys would just shut up and let

us get to this uh we'll fix the problems

for you don't don't worry but that again

comes from that False Consensus of how

what the problems are how they are to be

fixed uh but the most important point of

freedom of speech and uh the idea of

democracy in general uh is that we get

to argue about what the problems are in

the first place it's very clear to me

that there's not agreement in that today

uh but there is agreement

uh within the

institution uh the government is the

answer and I I think that's dangerous so

the more free speech the more free

protocols the more creative people

striving to create alternative ways to

interact uh the better because otherwise

these problems are going to be solved

for us uh and I I think in ways that are

historically harmful I think they

already have been and I think they'll

get worse absolutely why why don't we

take a question from from um from the

audience um first of all I'd like to say

thank you for um being you and living

the life you lived uh you're a big part

of the reason why I'm here and I'm sure

that's true for many of us um we've been

talking a lot about um Key Management

the past couple days and as someone

who's had to rely on public key Crypt

graphy um and uh now with a family I'm

curious if you have uh thoughts on the

challenges are the things you're waiting

uh waiting for to be built um where do

you think we should be focused when it

comes to making public key cryptography

work for regular

folk oh that's a good question that's a

hard one

uh the the minute you said and you know

now have a family I was like oh

yeah I guess my keys will die with me uh

because I I don't have a succession plan

or or anything like that at least for uh

my my beautiful custom brute

for and P um but

uh yeah this is one of the difficulties

excuse me um with Noster uh specifically

I'm not saying I have a better idea like

criticizing or or growing Stones here um

but for the average person like uh The

Disappearance of the username and

replacement with like this long you know

32 64 character string uh is like whoa

uh what is

that how that can be symbolically

represented in an abstracted way I do

think will be important to the success

of

Noster um

I think

uh Key

Management in the Raw public private key

model in the way that uh pgp gpg uh have

worked for ages uh is shown to

be basically not fit for normal humans

uh I used it back in the 2013

Revelations we were using pgp for

everything as a layer because I knew it

worked the reason I knew it worked is

because I worked at the NSA and I looked

uh in the Raw traffic in my last

position and things

um uh that I had been pulling out I was

looking at uh counter cyber activities

coming out of China uh and they weren't

really big on um pgp but I had seen

things come out of emails and streams

and whatnot uh where it was pgp

encrypted email and it was basically

returned with like uh no decrypt

provided um whereas you could get plain

text provided for certain other things

would be crypto systems or whatever like

there was an SSL Error or something like

that it happened sometimes uh the bottom

line was that it worked um history had

proven it worked it was an old protocol

but it was easy to make mistakes you

know people uh commonly send their

private Keys when they're supposed to be

sending public keys so basic things like

that you try to explain this to a

journalist who has no technical

background whatever uh they don't know

who you are so they don't take you very

seriously uh Glenn Greenwald famously

almost missed the story uh because I

literally recorded an entire explainer

video just for

him uh on how to use pgp and he was like

ah too busy

um and this is this is this is the kind

of thing we have to understand uh what

is approachable for ordinary people for

the expert class for the technical class

for the priesthood right we can figure

this stuff out some of these concepts

are familiar to us uh and that's great

but that does need to be hidden it does

need to be abstracted and we need to

find a way either to pair a username in

a way that there isn't a collision uh

there like you can't have sort of the

impersonation problems and everything

like that uh and I know we're kind of

trying to do that on Noster we've got 70

different providers because again it's

decentralized you should be able to do

that um but it's also like what is for

discoverability what is the source of

Truth uh is there a way that um kind of

like with Bitcoin we've got a threshold

where most decentralized providers agree

that for example Jack is Jack and they

provide you the right end pup maybe

maybe that works maybe that's a solution

I I I don't know uh but in general the

bottom line is like we know these forms

of cryptography work they are reliable

that's awesome that's great because

that's something that we can build on

but we also know that they're

incomprehensible uh to the average

person and it's just a question of how

do we bridge that Gap and I I'd love to

be the guy with the answers but I'm not

how

um Edward you're on you're on the board

of the um freedom of the press

foundation and one of the tasks of that

Foundation is to help build Technologies

for activists for whistleblowers and

journalists if you were to stack rank

yeah the greatest needs right now

independent of Noster and

Bitcoin what would that list look

like I mean our Marquee project that uh

we've been doing forever is secure drop

and that's because uh so for people who

aren't familiar secure drop is a system

that allows major newsrooms like the New

York Times The Washington Post like

every major Newsroom in the world uh

that handles uh anonymous tips to get a

system uh that is

pretty strongly hardened can be

connected to anonymously through tour uh

by any source and for them to provide

tips without revealing their identity

and this was what was missing in 2013 uh

for me right I I kind of had to uh craft

my own system out of you know uh

coconuts and glue uh to to to figure out

how I could reveal to journalists what

was going on um without them knowing who

I was

somehow convince them of Mo Motif vies

and at the same time not have them

intentionally or unintentionally which

was the real fear uh reveal my identity

to the government uh before I could

basically get all the evidence and get

out uh because the problem is none of

them were effectively

qualified uh

to handle that kind of problem uh you

you can't take an average journalist and

put them up against the NSA and expect

to win uh when it comes to something

like cob Communications over the

Internet uh secure drop was a method to

uh it is a method it's a system uh that

would allow people to basically get two

laptops where we've got cubes and a

stack of

uh uh programs like layered on them

applications all the way up uh to take

care of this for them and we know it

works and we know it's reliable and

actually has worked and some of the

biggest stories uh that you guys have R

have been through this system they

aren't actually revealed which ones are

and aren't because it's up to The

Newsroom to disclose that a lot of times

they don't want to disclose that uh

because they don't want to get in

trouble but but it works so now when we

think about it I I I think one of the

interesting things is

that we have good solutions for people

to come forward and to inform the media

about uh what's going on

but there's less trust in the media now

institution um because frankly uh a lot

of the most important media

organizations I didn't go to the New

York Times uh in 2013 quite famously uh

and that was because they had killed the

executive editor of the New York Times

uh Bill Keller had um

killed a story about warrantless

wiretapping by the Bush Administration

uh that should have been published one

month before his re-election and that

would have swung the election that

election was determined by a very small

mark

and if we had known this guy was

violating the Constitution to spy on

Americans and everyone in the world uh

we would have had a different history uh

and the consequence of that is is with

the New York Times hopefully they would

do better today but I'm I'm not

necessarily convinced that they

would uh and a lot of people are

confronting that so the question is

today like what are what are the needs

what can we do um instead I kind of feel

like uh something that the freedom the

Press Foundation might might be doing to

meet the unmet need is looking at uh

open source packages preexists today

like open broadcaster which is what I'm

using right now to bring my camera into

yours uh and basically create like um an

instruction stack for how people can

self-publish and maybe do it anonymously

and Incredibly is the problem because

you know there's so much content on the

internet there's so many

extravagant claims but how do

you establish bonafides right if I'm

talking to a journalist I could be like

hey you know I work here I'm this I'm

you know whatever government official uh

but I can't tell you my identity because

this or that but I can tell you about

this program and this program and this

program and this program and when you go

to government uh for comment their hair

is going to fall out um and and that

will establish uh to some extent that at

least I know things that only somewhere

in there should do but how do you

replicate this uh for the public without

sort of professional

verifiers uh and when we talk about you

know validators nowadays starts getting

into the idea of fact Checkers and fact

Checkers have not covered themselves in

glory either uh so it's it's an

interesting and difficult kind of

problem space but I think there's two

ways to look at it one is how do we

enable traditional classic journalism

the best forms of that and that's where

Source uh really has a lot on the line

tells journalists what they need to know

to inform the public we actually have a

good solution for that and it's got

better uh over over the last couple

years um but now how do we get sources

uh to come forward and to shoulder those

risks when they can't necessarily um

trust these classical institutions to

act in line uh with like our platonic

ideal of how they should act um and

that's really more of a media problem

than a technology problem we can't solve

all problems with technology but maybe

we can come up with an independent

solution I mean the old independent

solution for this was

Wikileaks um where you went look you

don't want to go to New York Times you

want to go to somebody else who then

will go to the new people forget this

people think Wikileaks just threw

everything on the internet uh but

actually they worked with all the

biggest newspapers in the world uh until

those newspapers betrayed them uh

organizationally uh the problem is we

see what happened to Julian Assange as a

consequence and so this is the idea you

know we sitting in conversation on the

other side of the world dreaming about

uh the solutions that we can come up

with to these problems um but you have

to think from the other side

adversarially there are governments like

in the plural not the singular uh we're

hearing this conversation uh and they're

hearing us create problems as opposed to

creating solutions they see see

Wikileaks they see public knowledge uh

as a problem to be solved uh and I I I

think we need to

be just Keen to the reality that the

world is marching toward the China ball

um I used to brief at the Joint Counter

Intelligence Training Academy um for the

defense intelligence agency uh on what

was called uh Chinese cyber Counter

Intelligence ridiculous kind of

government brand

uh but the idea here was it was

conference that would be held you know a

couple times a year just to teach new

analysts uh everything that uh we knew

about the Chinese government and how it

operated um and I was uh responsible for

this one little technology part of

it um but I had a theory that I

discussed with the other instructors

there that uh what we were seeing

because people were always trying to

guess you know what China is going to

look like in 5 years years and 10 years

who's going to be you know the the next

premere and all that uh this I I would

argue that there was a center of gravity

people were saying that we were going to

become China or that uh China was going

to become America basically uh that we

were going to adopt the other models and

I actually think it's different I I

think there is an authoritarian center

of

gravity that is pulling all manner of

governments toward it right um the China

government is very authoritarian many

governments around the world are very

authoritarian uh but what's interesting

is that we're seeing more liberal

governments becoming more authoritarian

uh Co was really a bright red warning

flag uh that it doesn't take much uh

sense of panic sense of emergency we're

seeing the same thing with Israel and

Hamas right

now uh where we go up but you know

somebody's crossed the line there's a

911 moment uh and the old rules no

longer apply classic rights will no

longer be protected the world has

changed so we as institutions will

change there's not time logistically for

a vote there's not time for a

conversation this is an emergency don't

you understand and so we need to use the

maximum extent of our capability of our

technology um to confront threat and

step by step bit by bit

uh you what you see is you see China and

the United States becoming more like you

see Europe and China becoming more like

they still differ there is distance

between them but the distance is narrow

and and that really is what should alarm

us particularly when you start looking

at capability when you look at

surveillance when you look at QR codes

when you look at control of money flows

when you look at control of

communications when you look at real

name policies and identities when you

look at the fact that there's you know

an everything app uh in China like we

chat that does you know payments it does

chat it does identity it does social

media uh it does travel it does tickets

um but the government in China requires

you to go into an office and ship ID in

order to activate your account and then

you hear Elon Musk saying oh X is going

to be in everything app he's starting to

pay people but then you have to tie it

to your identity in order to get paid uh

these are things that should really

alarm us anyway I know I got way off the

topic here the freedom of the press

Foundation uh but I I think the idea

here is

we need to understand what uh problems

can be technically addressed who are uh

our opponents in the uh ideological

space here um and if we can't solve the

problem uh

directly

um can we raise awareness of the problem

for people who maybe can and if we can't

if it's not possible uh within our

jurisdiction right if it's not possible

under our sets of laws if it's not

possible in your language in your

culture in your space under your

government uh can we create a new

jurisdiction this is the old sort of

Declaration of Independence of

cyberspace which so many people dunk on

today John Perry Barlo uh that said you

know oh you weary Giants of Flesh and

steel uh you have no power here

basically in the new domain of the mind

uh

this is our world it's our space we make

it as we wish um you are a guest you are

a visitor you don't make the decisions

and that frankly has not been

true

uh primarily because of the incentives

the corporate monetary structure uh

because of payment flows because of

Regulation because of know your customer

um but it's also I think

uh because the infrastructur is owned uh

were writing on somebody else's

cables uh we're crossing other people's

data centers and

paths all the Mesh networking ideas uh

haven't panned out they haven't scaled

they've had problems uh but just because

they haven't worked in the past does

that mean they will never work and I

don't think that's actually true I like

the idea of sort of optin networks of

fraternity of community uh where your

phone is just out there if you're

carrying a phone it's already a tracking

device right it's already reporting

itself uh to the network but if it

beacons out right in the same way all

these you know coid tracking Bluetooth

whatever is happening uh but it's a peak

in actually to other people of like mind

and just when you pass it makes a brief

network connection and you guys are sort

of sharing sharing a like uh passing

identifiers passing files whatever and

it's not a conscious decision you didn't

click a button it's just oh you you know

uh somebody out there you don't know who

they are uh you don't have to be sharing

identity you could be dark on the

network you could be dark node uh but

you just got the updates effectively on

your Noster timeline or whatever uh for

that person's little Community now you

realize this community exists now you

realize just sitting on the bus that

you're a little less alone than you

thought you were before uh and maybe you

know talking about um I'm not sure if I

just lost you guys we hear you looks

like I lost my we hear you but we don't

see the video but we can hear you clear

yeah I I uh I lost my video I'll restart

that in just a second I think my camera

might have

overheated uh but yeah what I was going

to go back to the with the Press side

I'll I'll turn this over uh and step

away just for a second maybe Jack you

take a question for the audience while I

work on this uh is you could walk past

The Newsroom and do the same thing this

is like a classic old spy technique of

the Dead Drop right like Cold War era

technology uh but imagine you know we

know the internet is too monitored

imagine for example uh t uh no longer is

reliable for protecting Communications

because we' got a global passive

adversary that can sort of unravel the

flows and it's not clear that that's

true today everybody's like oh tour's

broken tour doesn't work well I use Tour

all the time uh and I do depend on it

and it's been pretty good to me um

that's not to say you know uh it's

absolutely one thing you can bet your

life on uh because no system works that

way uh but assume that it didn't assume

that you couldn't have any network

communication like that well you could

actually have a device uh that you put

outside The Newsroom that is like that

somebody just walks past the office uh

and they've dropped off their tip their

file uh and then they walk right on by

and as long as it's not you know

strictly timestamped and indexed against

the security camera outside um all

journalists know is that they got a tip

and they can't reveal that person's

identity because they don't know it um

but all right let me step away and try

to try to fix this camera 100% it does

it does feel we're moving like the um

the everything app is going to be our

future and I love what you said about um

the Chinese and liberal governments

around the world becoming a lot more

alike and the Gap shrinking and it feels

like the the best thing it's just a

gravity yeah and the best thing that we

can do knowing that there will be these

everything apps and probably competing

across leral state lines is to have a

third option which is something like

Noster and something like Bitcoin where

you do have this um this potential for

all these apps to work together in a

very seamless way without the individual

using them having to consider how they

switch between that that was one of the

most powerful things for me in

encountering Nostra the first time is I

could literally take my secret key and

go to another client and everything just

worked and if you expand that to all

these micro apps and the univers of

micro apps then you basically have um

you basically have the everything app

but you have it on an open protocol

where everyone can build and it's a real

comp

ative uh answer to what China is

building and and what companies in the

US and and Western countries are

building and will most likely um given

the direction is is going to capture all

of us so we have an option and it's in

this room fortunately and I want to

thank you all for helping to build it so

we'll take another

question hi I was wondering uh besides

the inaccessibility through tour are

there any other scaling problems that

you've encountered while using noer or

are there any other things you'd like to

see noer

enable I think that one's for you Edward

if you're still

there yeah sorry

guys we're uh we're keeping it weird

right

yeah I mean

uh I actually think uh nosta is really

capable right now uh the main thing is

to to get people using it um I I've seen

some criticism of the the the lightning

Network integration with it um because

uh you know people have criticisms of

lightning lightning has worked um pretty

well for me I mean I've been excited I

see you know the zapathon and everything

anything like that uh and what I like

about it is that it's accessible for

normal PE the thing that I I don't like

about it is that uh you are replacing

one set of centralized gateways with

another in that nobody's running their

own uh sort of lightning node everybody

is using like uh you know an Albi or or

some other uh centralized uh provider

because they don't have their node

running uh and when they're offline like

lightning lightning doesn't work um

these are problems I I don't know how to

fix uh but the the core thing

is when we talk about things like video

publishing which is really really

popular uh for a lot of people's use

cases uh how are we going to host that

uh image hosting is expensive you know

video hosting and serving is way more

expensive uh

and the reason so much of the internet

has

worked uh in the way that we grew to

understand it was because like Jack said

there was there was VC money that was

quietly burning in Warehouse uh in the

background um what Google is doing right

now with YouTube is the best example of

that uh and kind of what makes me worry

for

the uh plausibility of of competing with

them on that uh is you look

and they are trying to monetize every

last inch of it all at the same time

like they've become very aggressive with

ad blocking they're running more

ads uh if you don't run an ad blocker

they'll run more and more and more and

more and more ads until you subscribe to

their

service uh and it's all happening at the

same time whereas

for the longest time YouTube was

something that was free and most of the

content that's on YouTube is not the

kind of thing that you would pay for uh

and and now suddenly they've changed the

game and you know YouTube has every

video on the internet on it even ones

that don't belong to them were just

ripped and re-uploaded from from

somewhere else uh but if you're talking

something like Noster like you know how

do we get videos up how do we host them

like on mass I I I know people can embed

uh things they're doing now and it's

actually beautiful it works wonderfully

i' I've had a good experience again when

I can connect um but if you think about

like a lot of people joining like uh the

Noster version of the fail whale uh

are like we've got all these relays and

all of these relays have notes that are

being Ritt to them that basically links

to these other sites how are we going to

deal with bit rot right when when we've

got one repository like that and the

repository goes down or but like the

first mover becomes you know the sacred

cow that we can't get rid of uh because

if they drop uh we are uh we are losing

a central part of the network and losing

the history that comes with it uh these

are these are tough questions I think um

but when you think about the basic

capabilities for Noster uh the thing

that gets me excited is just the idea

that it's like Twitter people like

Twitter they enjoy Twitter uh without

all of the corporate Gates and

everything like that I think what people

need uh is the discoverability problem

like like you said like I don't know if

they're Community list or something like

that where for the onboarding for the UI

they go what are you interested in and

it explains that this like all this is

doing is this is adding some popular

accounts or trending accounts or

whatever for this to get you start you

can still change it you can do whatever

you can take them out you can uh uh uh

intersect this with block lists or

ignore lists or whatever lists um so

people very quickly can start saying who

are the the the people on Noster who are

talking about interesting things they

come in they have an account they see

interesting things happening and they go

how do I how do I um do this and then

they uh put out their note everybody

sees it and like then they're off the

races actually there is a question there

if they're not having any following them

how how does that get seen do we have uh

sort of the different Noster apps

whether it's you know damus whether it's

amethyst whatever uh they kind of we've

got a guy who curates for those

different networks uh these are brand

new accounts like on the relays

basically flag these are the first times

these UBS have ever done any activity

and you know 99% of it going to be like

Chinese spam or something like that uh

but to look through it and go oh look

this is an actual person or it seems

like an actual person they're saying

something interesting or whatever and it

just does like uh you know a call out or

a showcase that like tries to get this

person their first 10 followers or

something like that uh when you enter

the app like I think these ways of

welcoming community of growing community

of like easing the onboarding process

that's really important but the the main

thing is I'm actually a little worried

right now like we don't want the March

the influx the crush of a zillion new

users to all come right now uh because

I'm not sure that Noster is ready for uh

prime

time in that like we don't have that

really friendly on boarding we don't

have the the key management thing solved

and if you get a thousand thousand a

million people to show up uh you want

them to have a good experience from the

get-go otherwise they might not come

back but if they do come back then

they're going to tell all their friends

there's this thing that's better than

than what you're already using uh and

you know you can do your Tik Tok videos

but you don't have to deal with you know

Tik Tock using AI or you know machine

learning or whatever to listen uh to

what you're saying and if you use the

wrong word like it down ranks your your

video or whatever instead you can just

share things for your friends and you

share things with your friends your

friends are interacting with your

friends and there's no midle like that's

powerful that's interesting that's

different

uh and I you know we we'll have a lot of

problems to deal with down the road but

the main thing is make it work uh make

it easy make it friendly make it

interesting uh and we don't actually

have to make it interesting we just have

to call attention to what is interesting

uh but somebody who doesn't know even

what accounts to follow like that some

of that work has to be done for them

yeah I it's a it's a good reminder it's

come up in a few conversations that we

you know we we may not have the number

of users that we see the potential of

this for because we're not attracting

people who are not attracted by

censorship resistance right now and

decentralization and and that's actually

okay the deliberate and thus slow path

is the one that lasts ultimately and we

can take this time to really get it

right for people and to learn and to

ensure that um we're presenting

something that that will last will be

resilient against all these adversaries

that will come and the the more we try

to rush that too soon um the let the the

the more likely those things will be

hidden from us and uh and unfortunately

not you know we wouldn't have the time

to to fix them we're we're coming up on

on Time Edward I I just want to I want

to ask two final questions one of the

things I appreciate about noer the most

and early Twitter is just how real it is

and how authentic it is and I've I think

I've seen every single interview with

you I haven't heard a lot about

just my first question is I just haven't

heard a lot about what your life is like

your your day the the the small the

small details that like bring you Joy in

your current in your current day and

then the second question related is um

you know what are those details at home

but like the second question is there

anything that we can do as

individuals collectively to help bring

you home as

well thank you I mean uh on on that

second one I'm that's the the easier

question I'm not

sure uh that there really is until we

get uh more sane more more stable

governments I mean the Biden

Administration is effectively the Obama

Administration uh there all holdovers

they're all people who were previously

in there and they're they're really

hardcore uh committed ideologues in a

way that you wouldn't expect it was a

way that people actually talked about

the Trump Administration as being but

the Trump Administration was really

frankly a lot of

um bunglers and incompetence it's not

clear uh that they had a Comm ideology

there were a lot of ideologues in there

uh including completely insane people

like John bolt uh but you know they

didn't share a common unifying Vision

actually it was basically just whoever

was willing to show up and they you know

tried to be like like government for a

day and they they failed miserably uh

because of that uh the Biden Obama

administration these guys are long-term

government workers doing what the

government's going to do which is why

you see like the Gary gers out there

that are uh you know they're they're

using the agency uh they're using the

procedural rules uh where they don't

even have to legislate they're just

going we're going to interfere with the

way the world operates we're going to

make law without making law uh for as

long as we can until we're forced we

know you guys can go to the courts uh

because we know what we're doing is

illegal it's unlawful uh but it's going

to take 10 years it's going to take 20

years before Shea can force our hand on

that and for us that's pretty much good

enough uh we push it back far far enough

and that's something like a victory for

us uh when it comes to coming home it

it's we have to get people who

uh are willing to

recognize uh that what the government

did was wrong which is interesting

because the courts have already ruled on

that is shouldn't be too

controversial uh a statement to be made

even Obama's Attorney General Eric

Holder said you know he believed what I

did was a public service he still thinks

I should go to jail but he's willing to

say you know it's a public service and

of course he was personally implicated

in these programs uh by virtue of the

fact he was attorney general at the time

uh but these guys retire these people

die these people move on right they age

uh and the conveyor continues uh if we

get a sane and reasonable government

it's possible we can have conversations

about like how how does that go on but I

I don't think realistically we we see

that in the near-term future uh much

more important much more urgent and much

more near is uh the case of Julian

Assange I mean this guy has been in a

bad bad prison for a long long time like

he's in Terrorist level custody uh for

publishing the truth uh the unpalatable

truth true for these governments but

things that are true um and that that is

a really it's an indictment of our our

society uh not just in the United States

but in the west broadly uh everyone uh

understands that this is wrong U but

nobody does anything about it and in

fact a lot of the

major uh Legacy Media institutions that

have the voice to change this are

largely silent they have to their credit

uh said they shouldn't be done but

they're not agitating they're not

continuing on this because they're all

worried about the political implications

they're all worried about uh sort of a

return of Donald Trump theoretically and

so they won't do anything that will call

out uh frankly the hypocrisy of the

Biden Administration when you got the

Secretary of State out there uh Tony

blinkin saying you know to like Egypt or

something like that it's terrible

freedom of speech don't impris

journalists for printing the truth and

then like he's standing on the bound

body of Julian Sange as a Podium when

when he's giving this statement and

nobody says anything about that that's

that's terrible thing so we we need some

kind of uh connection there um and then

yeah I I don't talk about my uh personal

life uh in interviews that that's

actually something that uh I've just as

a privacy Advocate I've always done but

what I will say uh is that you know I've

become a parent

boy uh these last two and a half years

have been really really tough it's

another reason that my uh my tweet

frequency has gone down uh I had so much

free time uh before now I I have none

but it that's not to say that it's it's

not worthwhile I'm trying to begin uh

writing again I'm trying to begin

producing again it's slow and you know

my kids are only going to be this age

for so long so it's all right I don't

resent it I don't regret it uh it's

wonderful

but the nice moments are every night uh

my eldest son uh I read him to sleep uh

right now I'm reading him uh Adam

Smith's The Wealth of Nations uh he's

not a fan he actually prefers we the

Poo um but uh I I I try to switch it up

I read him I read him Alison

Wonderland I read him wiy the I read a

lot of children's books that I get off

like a a Project Gutenberg or something

like that just classic

literature uh but then I also try to

read him um these crazy things uh Civil

Disobedience uh Henry David thow I read

him the whole of that he didn't mind

that as much because it was short um

when I uh put that out on noer uh it was

because I had been reading it to my son

and I was uh ref familiarized with the

quotes uh one that if people are looking

for uh reading suggestions they're a

little

less

uh uh sort of familiar or or commonplace

but are very interesting uh there's one

I I believe called uh discourses on

voluntary servitude by ettien deti which

is like impossible to type but if you

just look for discourse on voluntary

servitude I think it's very much in line

with the ethos of uh Noster and you guys

should check it out it's another one of

those it's actually quite short so it's

not hard to work through like the weal

of Nations um but yeah I mean if you ask

me what brings me joy it's the fact that

I could see uh my kids growing they've

gone from you

know just being little potatoes that

make sound uh to being active thinking

beings uh that are reasoning that do not

agree oh my goodness my children are so

so

disobedient uh but you know I guess it's

in the

genes uh and there there there's nothing

wrong with that I I like it a lot I

gotta learn to uh be the disciplinarian

the authoritarian to the extent

necessary um but this is something that

we all need to confront actually and I I

think for this audience is very

important uh

because if for those of you who are of a

certain age uh like Jack and I am

if you understand the internet if you

understand how it fits together if you

understand the protocols if you

understand the technology if you

understand the interfaces if you

understand the goys if you don't know

what a program is but you can just pick

it up you can figure it out uh there's a

new app uh you don't need the

instruction manual right uh you are not

the average uh we need to remember that

there are kids growing up every day that

are having their first experience is

with these systems they don't know how

they work uh even most people graduating

from like high school today um they

don't use computers they use phones they

don't know how the phone works they know

they go to the App Store they ask the

app store for the app they install the

app the app has you know three tutorial

swipes and and that's it the rest is

Magic I think we need to help them

understand not just how to use these

apps

but how to control them we need to make

sure that when we're Building Systems

when we're building protocols they are

accessible uh one of the things I worry

about with crypto more broadly whether

you're talking about Bitcoin or ethereum

is there is kind of

a impulse toward embracing the

Arcane uh where they have you know all

these Improvement protocols or whatever

and they come up with all these new

names and all these new terms and they

start writing like academic papers for

like academic audiences uh and they

don't make it accessible so then you're

creating new clergy you're creating a

new priesthood you're creating a new

special class and what we don't want is

to replicate the problems of the old

where we have specialist conversations

among specialist institutions and it's

all lobbyists and stakeholders and the

average person cannot even Be Imagined

to understand this unless they

themselves become an expert uh we want

Ordinary People to be able to see this

to understand how it works uh you know

maybe the connections to like relays or

how notes move or something like that

there's just a you know cute little map

or something like that some animation

some um whether it's an infographic or

or something that just displays what's

going on so people see it I think you

know and this is one of the things when

I look at my kids and I I think about

how I'm going to spend the the next

years of my life uh we need more

education in the world uh to explain to

people just how the devices how the

systems how the networks that surround

us that we depend on how they function

how they can interact with them how they

can control them how they can direct

them without it being like you know a a

dry programming tutorial or something uh

that kind of symbolic understanding is

missing it's a gap we have those who

know and we have those who don't you

know when you talk about we got this

name Noster it's kind of like a

gnostic uh and gnosticism you have

people who have the revealed truth and

those who don't uh but that's not the

ideal if we want things to get better uh

we don't need to be uh creating a

religion um we need to be creating a

science and it needs to be more like the

age of the citizen scientist uh in which

we all have a hand so with that I I just

want to say thank you to everyone thank

you Jack for the invitation this has

been wonderful I really appreciate all

of your support for everything that's

Community for the freedom of the press

Foundation uh and for you personally

frankly like I said just for sticking

around and trying to make things better

as opposed to just relaxing uh because

it's been uh a pretty depressing time I

think for a lot of people uh who are in

this community who do understand the

direction the internet is going the

direction your politics are going they

see this gravity occurring uh and it

feels inevitable to have someone like

you on our side uh I think it it it

stiffens the spine um and it gives us

hope so I hope you'll be uh with here

for us with us uh in this and uh

together I hope we can lead the way uh

to really a better system and a better

world thank you we will

um

we're

um on on nosta we're really big on

hugs and and while we can't give you a

hug physically today I know we will in

the future but in the meantime I just

wanted to ask everyone to take out the

client of their choice their device and

just send snow in a hug through a post

through a note and uh hopefully you can

you can feel our admiration and our love

and our gratefulness for you and

um I hope to see you soon we will I

really appreciate it it's wonderful

thank you and I will I'll see you soon

okay thank you thank you thank you

[Applause]

all
